interface User {
  preferences: {
    integrations?: Record<string, any>; // NEW: Platform integration storage
    // ... existing preferences
  };
}

// Platform Integration Management
interface PlatformIntegration {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  connected: boolean;
  status: 'connected' | 'error' | 'disconnected';
  lastSync?: string;
}
```

### Key Code Integrations

#### New Integrations Tab
```typescript
// API Key Management with Platform Integration
const integrations = [
  { id: 'google_ads', name: 'Google Ads', icon: '🔍' },
  { id: 'meta_ads', name: 'Meta Ads (Facebook)', icon: '📘' },
  { id: 'linkedin_ads', name: 'LinkedIn Ads', icon: '💼' }
];

// Direct Platform Setup Integration
onClick={() => window.location.href = '/platforms'}
```

#### Avatar Upload System
```typescript
// File Upload with Image Preview
const handleAvatarUpload = (file: File) => {
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = (e) => {
    // Process image and update user profile
    // Integration with Supabase Storage ready
  };
};
```

#### Toast Notification Integration
```typescript
// Comprehensive User Feedback
showToast({
  type: 'success',
  title: 'Settings saved successfully',
  description: 'Your preferences have been updated.'
});
```
