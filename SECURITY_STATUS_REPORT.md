## If Any Tests Fail

**Scenario 1: Protected routes are NOT redirecting to login**
- Issue: Middleware may not be deployed yet
- Solution: Wait for Vercel deployment, then retry

**Scenario 2: Login works but can't access dashboard**
- Issue: RLS policies may be blocking access
- Solution: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM public.profiles WHERE email = 'devtestai.os@gmail.com';
  ```
  Share the result with me.

**Scenario 3: Can't access /admin even as super_admin**
- Issue: Role check in middleware may have issue
- Solution: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, email, role FROM public.profiles WHERE email = 'devtestai.os@gmail.com';
  ```
  Verify role is exactly 'super_admin'

**Scenario 4: Console shows "Database error"**
- Issue: RLS policy may be too restrictive
- Solution: Take screenshot of full error and share with me
