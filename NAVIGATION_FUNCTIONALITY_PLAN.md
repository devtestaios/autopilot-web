## üõ† **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Development Approach:**
1. **Incremental Development:** Build one feature at a time, test, then move to next
2. **API-First:** Ensure backend endpoints are working before frontend integration
3. **Mobile-First:** Test all features on mobile devices first
4. **Accessibility:** Maintain high accessibility standards throughout

### **Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests for API connections
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing across devices and browsers

### **Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy loading for large data sets
- Debounced search and filter operations
- Optimized bundle sizes
- Efficient state updates
