# üö® RENDER DEPLOYMENT FIX GUIDE

## Issue: Render Deployment Failing After Instagram Environment Variables

### Likely Causes:
1. **New Instagram OAuth endpoints** causing deployment issues
2. **Missing environment variables** in Render causing startup failures  
3. **Instagram API imports** not properly handled
4. **Environment variable conflicts** between old and new app credentials

### üéØ IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS

#### Step 1: Update Your Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render dashboard and update these variables with your **NEW** app credentials:

```bash
# Replace with your NEW app credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_new_app_id_here
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your_new_app_secret_here

# Ensure these are also set
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://pulsebridge.ai
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_new_app_id_here
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_new_app_secret_here
```

#### Step 2: Add Missing Environment Variables
Make sure ALL these variables are set in Render:

```bash
# Core Application
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Instagram/Facebook (NEW APP)
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_new_app_id
INSTAGRAM_APP_SECRET=your_new_app_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=your_new_app_id
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=your_new_app_secret

# Base URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://pulsebridge.ai
```

#### Step 3: Check For Required Dependencies
The Instagram OAuth endpoints I added should not require additional dependencies, but let's verify.

### üîß TROUBLESHOOTING SPECIFIC ERRORS

#### Error: "Module not found" or Import Errors
**Fix**: The OAuth endpoints use only standard Python libraries. No additional requirements needed.

#### Error: "Environment variable not found"
**Fix**: Ensure ALL environment variables from your old app are copied to the new app settings.

#### Error: "Instagram API connection failed"
**Fix**: The current implementation uses mock data, so API connection shouldn't cause deployment failures.

### üìã RENDER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] New Instagram App ID added to environment variables
- [ ] New Instagram App Secret added to environment variables  
- [ ] All old environment variables copied over
- [ ] Supabase credentials still present
- [ ] No syntax errors in backend code
- [ ] Latest GitHub commit pushed successfully

### üöÄ QUICK DEPLOYMENT TEST

After updating environment variables:

1. **Check Render Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Environment**: Ensure all variables are set correctly
3. **Test Health Endpoint**: Visit `https://autopilot-api-1.onrender.com/health`
4. **Manual Redeploy**: Trigger manual deployment if auto-deploy failed

### üìû NEXT STEPS

1. **Update environment variables with your NEW app credentials**
2. **Check Render deployment logs for specific errors**
3. **Provide error details if deployment still fails**

## üéØ What Are Your NEW App Credentials?

Please provide:
- **New Instagram App ID**: `____________`
- **New Instagram App Secret**: `____________`
- **New Facebook App ID**: `____________` 
- **New Facebook App Secret**: `____________`

I'll help you verify they're correctly configured!

### üîç Common Fix: Environment Variable Conflicts

If you're getting environment variable errors, it's likely because:
1. **Old app credentials** are still in some variables
2. **New app credentials** need to be in ALL Instagram/Facebook variables
3. **Missing variables** that were in your old setup

**Solution**: Copy ALL environment variables from your working setup and update ONLY the Instagram/Facebook related ones with the new app credentials.
