# 🧪 Tiered Architecture Demo Guide

**Quick Testing Guide for TaskMaster vs ProjectSuite Implementation**

## 🎯 **DEMO INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Test TaskMaster Tier (Default)**
The system starts in TaskMaster tier by default. Visit these pages to see the simplified experience:

#### **TaskMaster Dashboard**: `/task-master`
- **Features**: Simplified 3-column kanban board (To Do → Doing → Done)
- **Interface**: Clean, unintimidating design for solo entrepreneurs
- **Upgrade Hints**: Strategic upgrade prompts for enterprise features

#### **Project Management**: `/project-management`
- **Budget Tracking**: Shows upgrade prompt instead of full budget management
- **Team Management**: Displays upgrade prompt for team collaboration features
- **Analytics View**: Large upgrade prompt for advanced analytics
- **Project Creation**: Limited to 1 project (shows upgrade prompt for additional projects)

### **2. Test ProjectSuite Tier (Enterprise)**
To test the full enterprise experience, you need to upgrade the tier programmatically:

#### **Option A: Browser Console (Immediate)**
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
localStorage.setItem('userTier', 'projectsuite');
// Then refresh the page
```

#### **Option B: Component Method (Development)**
```typescript
// In any component with access to useUserTier:
const { setTier } = useUserTier();
setTier('projectsuite');
```

## 🔄 **TESTING WORKFLOW**

### **Step 1: TaskMaster Experience**
1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000/task-master`
2. **Observe**: Simplified kanban interface with upgrade hints
3. **Test**: Try to access enterprise features → see upgrade prompts

### **Step 2: Project Management Restrictions**  
1. **Visit**: `http://localhost:3000/project-management`
2. **Create Project**: Create your first project (allowed)
3. **Try Second Project**: Attempt to create another → upgrade prompt
4. **Check Analytics**: Click Analytics view → upgrade prompt
5. **View Team Section**: Check team stats → upgrade prompt

### **Step 3: Upgrade to ProjectSuite**
1. **Open Console**: `F12` → Console tab
2. **Run**: `localStorage.setItem('userTier', 'projectsuite')`
3. **Refresh**: `F5` to reload page
4. **Verify**: All features now accessible

### **Step 4: Validation Checklist**
- [ ] TaskMaster shows simplified interface
- [ ] Enterprise features show upgrade prompts
- [ ] ProjectSuite unlocks all features
- [ ] No console errors during tier switching
- [ ] UI remains consistent across tiers

## 🎨 **UI/UX VALIDATION POINTS**
