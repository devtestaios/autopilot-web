-- ✅ Complete RLS policies and security measures
```

### **Priority 2: Connect AuthContext to Real Database**
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
```typescript

// Action: Update to use your comprehensive User interface with 25+ fields
// Impact: Real user profiles, sessions, security events, audit trails
```

### **Priority 3: Enable Admin Dashboard with Real Data**
**Files**: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/app/adminlogin/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Current: Mock data with localStorage authentication
// Action: Connect to profiles table with real user management
// Impact: Immediate ability to manage 1000+ users through database
```
