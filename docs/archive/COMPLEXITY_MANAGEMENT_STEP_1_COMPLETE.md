    // Business size matching  
    if (businessSize && !feature.businessSizes.includes(businessSize)) return false;
    // Category and difficulty filtering
    return true;
  });
};

// Relevance Scoring Algorithm
const getFeaturePriority = (feature: Feature): number => {
  let score = 0;
  // Goal alignment scoring (3 points per match)
  // Business size scoring (2 points for difficulty match)
  // Total: 0-100 relevance score
  return score;
};
