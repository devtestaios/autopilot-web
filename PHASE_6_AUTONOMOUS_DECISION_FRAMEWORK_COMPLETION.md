- **Platform Integrations**: Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads connectors
- **Queue Management**: Priority-based execution with scheduling
- **Rollback Strategies**: Automatic recovery from failed executions
- **Monitoring**: Real-time execution tracking with health status

### ✅ API Endpoints (autonomous_decision_endpoints.py)
- **15+ REST Endpoints** for complete autonomous control:
  - `/api/v1/autonomous/analyze` - Decision opportunity analysis
  - `/api/v1/autonomous/decisions/pending` - Pending decisions management
  - `/api/v1/autonomous/execute` - Decision execution
  - `/api/v1/autonomous/emergency-stop` - Emergency controls
  - `/api/v1/autonomous/performance/summary` - System performance
  - Complete approval workflows and learning feedback

## 🛡️ Advanced Safety Systems

### Key Features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly autonomous control
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- **Risk Visualization**: Color-coded risk levels with confidence scores
- **Impact Forecasting**: Expected outcomes for each decision
- **Emergency Controls**: Immediate access to safety overrides

## 📊 Technical Architecture Achievements

### Sophisticated Decision Making
```python
# Example: Intelligent budget optimization
if current_roas > target_roas * 1.2:  # 20% above target
    # Propose budget increase with safety checks
    proposed_increase = min(current_budget * 0.3, max_budget)
    confidence_score = 0.8
    risk_level = RiskLevel.MEDIUM
```

### Advanced Safety Evaluation
```python
# Multi-guardrail safety checking
for guardrail in self.safety_guardrails:
    check_result = await self._evaluate_guardrail(guardrail, decision, context)
    if check_result['failed'] and guardrail.block_execution:
        decision.auto_execute_allowed = False
        decision.requires_human_approval = True
```

### Learning and Improvement
```python
# Continuous learning from outcomes
accuracy = 1 - abs(predicted_value - actual_value) / abs(predicted_value)
model_adjustments = {
    'confidence_adjustment': -0.1 if accuracy < 0.5 else 0.05,
    'prediction_model_update': True
}
```
